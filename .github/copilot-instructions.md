- Clean typography with plenty of white space
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations
- Fully responsive design for all devices
- Focus on visual hierarchy and user experience

## Code Style

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Follow modern React best practices
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility

## Component Structure
